## Threecolts PHP hiring test

### The process

Please implement the 2 functions as described in the src/Urlcounter.php file.

Requirements:

- Do not edit the composer.json file. In particular, do not add any libraries to it
- index.php should not have compiler errors
- All your code should exist within a single file: src/UrlCounter.php
- If you write tests, these can live in a separate file. You can use phpunit for them

At the end of the hour, please:

- Attach your solution UrlCounter.php to the form
- Optional: if you wrote any tests, please attach them to the same form

If you have any questions take your best guess.
After delivering the solution, feel free to send comments or questions our way,

Best of luck,
The Threecolts team
